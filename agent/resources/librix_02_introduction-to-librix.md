# Introduction to LibriX: A Network State for Financial Freedom

## Overview

LibriX is a revolutionary network state designed to empower individuals with unprecedented financial freedom. By combining cutting-edge advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, LibriX redefines the relationship between citizens and the economy. At its core, LibriX functions as a borderless, decentralized digital nation that provides a Universal Basic Income (UBI) to its citizens, funded entirely by the economic value generated by autonomous AI agents.

## Vision

At LibriX, we envision a world where every individual has access to financial security and the tools to thrive, regardless of their location or socioeconomic background. By leveraging the power of autonomous AI agents, we aim to create a self-sustaining economy that works for the benefit of all citizens, fostering a global ecosystem of opportunity, equality, and innovation.

## Mission

Our mission is to establish a fully autonomous, citizen-focused economic model that provides UBI funded by AI-driven value creation. LibriX is committed to empowering its citizens to take control of their financial futures by bypassing traditional government systems and embracing a decentralized, inclusive approach.

## Key Features

### Universal Basic Income (UBI)

LibriX ensures financial stability for all its citizens through a guaranteed UBI distributed regularly. This income is funded by the economic output of autonomous AI agents, eliminating the need for taxation.

### Autonomous AI Agents

AI-driven economic agents are at the heart of LibriX’s economy. These agents operate across various sectors, from digital marketing and e-commerce to NFT creation and cryptocurrency trading, continuously generating value to sustain and grow the nation’s economy.

### Decentralized Governance

LibriX aims to employ a decentralized governance model where citizens vote on budget allocations, policy directions, and national priorities. This ensures that the community’s collective voice shapes the future of the nation.

### NFT-Based Citizenship and Passport System

Citizenship in LibriX is represented by a unique, non-fungible token (NFT) that also functions as a digital passport. This system ensures security, transparency, and ownership of one’s membership in the nation.

### Skill-Based and Scholarship-Based Citizenship

To foster a thriving and diverse community, citizenship is initially granted based on relevant skills that contribute to the development of the nation. As LibriX grows, scholarships will provide opportunities for those lacking the required skills, ensuring inclusivity and equal access.
