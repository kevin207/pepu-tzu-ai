## Vision and Mission

## The Problem and Opportunity

The world faces a growing economic challenge with the rise of AI and automation displacing jobs, widening income inequality, and governments struggling to implement effective solutions like UBI. LibriX sees an opportunity to turn AI into an economic ally by creating a decentralized nation where autonomous agents generate wealth, redistribute it fairly, and empower citizens to take control of their financial futures.

## How LibriX Works

### 1. Citizenship Acquisition

- **Phase 1**: Skill-based selection to attract contributors (developers, marketers, AI trainers).
- **Phase 2**: Scholarships to enable wider participation by equipping individuals with essential skills.

### 2. Passport NFT

- A blockchain-based, non-transferable digital asset representing citizenship and access to UBI.
