# How It Works

## Citizenship Acquisition

LibriX citizenship is designed to attract skilled contributors and empower individuals to become part of the nation’s AI-driven economy. The process evolves through two key phases:

### 1. Phase 1: Skill-Based Selection for Contributors

In the initial phase, citizenship is granted to individuals with skills that can contribute to the development and growth of the nation. This includes:

- Developers proficient in building and integrating AI systems.
- Marketers skilled in promoting digital assets such as meme coins and NFTs.
- AI trainers capable of improving agent performance and efficiency.
- Active LibriX community members that can help grow and market the network state.

By focusing on skilled individuals, LibriX ensures a strong foundation for its AI-driven economy.

### 2. Phase 2: Scholarships for Skill Development

To foster inclusivity, the second phase introduces scholarships that provide training for individuals without the required skills. These programs equip participants with knowledge in AI development, blockchain technology, and digital marketing, enabling them to actively contribute to the nation’s growth.

## Passport NFT

The LibriX Passport NFT is a cornerstone of the network state, functioning as both a digital representation of citizenship and a gateway to the nation’s benefits.

- **Access to UBI**: Each passport grants the holder access to Universal Basic Income (UBI) distributions.
- **Blockchain-Based Verification**: Passports are unique, verifiable on the blockchain, and non-transferable, ensuring the integrity of citizenship records.
- **Non-transferable**: The NFTs are tied to KYC (Know Your Customer) processes to prevent Sybil attacks and ensure each citizen represents a real individual.

Later, when better blockchain identity methods are available, the LibriX passport might switch systems. For example, [World ID](https://world.org) is an interesting option, but it's not available in any country yet, which makes it currently not compatible with our all-inclusion policy.

## AI Agent Creation and Management

LibriX citizens play an active role in building and managing the AI agents that drive the nation’s economy. These agents are at the heart of the revenue generation process.

### 1. Tools and Technologies for AI Agent Creation

Citizens have access to cutting-edge AI models, tools, and integrations to create and enhance economic agents:

- **Latest LLM Models**: GPT, MidJourney, Anthropic, Qwen, and others are used for generative tasks.
- **AI Tools**: TapeAgents, Fetch, and Swarm for agent orchestration and multi-agent frameworks.
- **API Integrations**: APIs from platforms like Coinbase, X.com, and others expand the functionality of AI agents.
- **Multi-Agent Models**: Complex workflows are enabled through multi-agent architectures.
- **Reasoning Scripts**: Agentic workflows are optimized with advanced reasoning algorithms and scripts.

### 2. Revenue Generation and Distribution

- **AI agents** operate in sectors like marketing, trading, and e-commerce, generating significant revenue.
- The **revenue** from all agents is pooled into a national treasury and **distributed to citizens as UBI**, creating a sustainable economic model.

## Governance Model

LibriX embraces a decentralized governance model, empowering citizens to shape the nation’s direction through democratic participation.

### 1. Decentralized Voting System

Citizens vote on key decisions such as:

- **Budget allocation** for developing and maintaining AI agents.
- **Strategic priorities** for expanding the nation’s economic footprint.

### 2. Participatory Governance

By participating in governance, citizens ensure that LibriX remains aligned with their collective interests, maintaining transparency and accountability in decision-making processes.
