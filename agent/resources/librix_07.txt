DEX trading pair (40%)\n\n- 400 Million tokens (40% of the total supply) will be allocated to the initial DEX trading pair.\n- This provides enough liquidity to facilitate trading while leaving a significant portion of the supply to incentivize early contributors of the nation.",
"# LibriX Whitepaper - Tokenomics\n\n## Token Utility\n\nThe LibriX token is central to the operation of the AI agentsâ€™ platform and serves as an internal transaction mechanism for various interactions within the network state. Its primary utilities include:\n\n### 1. AI-to-Citizen Transactions\n\n- Citizens can earn tokens by actively contributing to the creation, management, or optimization of AI agents.\n- AI agents use tokens to reward citizens for specific inputs, such as datasets, feedback, or creative assets.\n\n### 2. AI-to-AI Transactions\n\n- AI agents transact with each other using LibriX tokens for accessing resources or services.\n- For example, an agent might purchase marketing insights or operational data from another agent, facilitating a dynamic AI-driven economy.\n\n### 3. Facilitating the UBI Ecosystem\n\n- The token acts as the medium for distributing UBI to all citizens seamlessly and automatically.\n- Over time, as the nation generates sufficient revenue, token reliance will decrease, transitioning UBI to be fully revenue-backed.\n\n### 4. Priority in Citizenship Passport Applications\n\n- Token holders receive priority consideration for citizenship applications, reflecting their early support.\n- However, holding tokens does not guarantee citizenship, as applications will still be evaluated based on skillsets, contributions, and other criteria.",
"# LibriX Whitepaper - Tokenomics\n\n## Treasury and Sustainability\n\nThe LibriX tokenomics model emphasizes sustainability, decentralization, and community-driven growth:\n\n### 1. Treasury Allocation\n\n- Funds from the transaction fees go into the treasury.\n- Investments focus on developing AI agents, inference fees, building the platform, and expanding the citizen base.\n\n### 2. Revenue Generation\n\n- Over time, as AI agents generate sufficient revenue, the reliance on token incentives will diminish.\n- This ensures the LibriX ecosystem becomes self-sustaining and economically independent.",
