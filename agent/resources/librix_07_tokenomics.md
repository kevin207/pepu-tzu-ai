# Tokenomics

The LibriX token serves as the economic backbone of the network state, ensuring a sustainable and incentivized ecosystem during its early stages of development. It is designed to enable interactions within the LibriX ecosystem, reward active contributions, and support governance through citizen participation.

## Purpose of the LibriX Token

The LibriX token is a utility token designed exclusively for use within the LibriX ecosystem. It facilitates transactions, governance, and the distribution of Universal Basic Income (UBI). Importantly, it is not an investment vehicle and does not guarantee profits or appreciation in value. Participants should view the token as a medium for accessing and contributing to the LibriX platform.

## Token Supply and Distribution

The total supply of LibriX tokens is capped at 1 billion, ensuring scarcity and long-term value. The distribution is structured to support ecosystem growth while maintaining fairness and alignment with community-driven principles.

### 1. Incentive for Contributors (60%)

- 600 Million tokens (60% of the total supply) will be allocated to early contributors.
- These tokens will be distributed over two years to reward developers, marketers, AI trainers, and others actively building the network.
- This incentivized period ensures rapid growth and acknowledges the active participation of contributors.

### 2. DEX trading pair (40%)

- 400 Million tokens (40% of the total supply) will be allocated to the initial DEX trading pair.
- This provides enough liquidity to facilitate trading while leaving a significant portion of the supply to incentivize early contributors of the nation.

## Token Utility

The LibriX token is central to the operation of the AI agentsâ€™ platform and serves as an internal transaction mechanism for various interactions within the network state. Its primary utilities include:

### 1. AI-to-Citizen Transactions

- Citizens can earn tokens by actively contributing to the creation, management, or optimization of AI agents.
- AI agents use tokens to reward citizens for specific inputs, such as datasets, feedback, or creative assets.

### 2. AI-to-AI Transactions

- AI agents transact with each other using LibriX tokens for accessing resources or services.
- For example, an agent might purchase marketing insights or operational data from another agent, facilitating a dynamic AI-driven economy.

### 3. Facilitating the UBI Ecosystem

- The token acts as the medium for distributing UBI to all citizens seamlessly and automatically.
- Over time, as the nation generates sufficient revenue, token reliance will decrease, transitioning UBI to be fully revenue-backed.

### 4. Priority in Citizenship Passport Applications

- Token holders receive priority consideration for citizenship applications, reflecting their early support.
- However, holding tokens does not guarantee citizenship, as applications will still be evaluated based on skillsets, contributions, and other criteria.

## Treasury and Sustainability

The LibriX tokenomics model emphasizes sustainability, decentralization, and community-driven growth:

### 1. Treasury Allocation

- Funds from the transaction fees go into the treasury.
- Investments focus on developing AI agents, inference fees, building the platform, and expanding the citizen base.

### 2. Revenue Generation

- Over time, as AI agents generate sufficient revenue, the reliance on token incentives will diminish.
- This ensures the LibriX ecosystem becomes self-sustaining and economically independent.
